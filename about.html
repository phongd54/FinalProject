  <center><h3 class="text-muted">Our main goal for doing this project is to explore new possibilities for building an application where users can upload their images onto the site and have others rate it. We want more users to participate with uploading pictures by giving them an incentive of a cash prize, as well as having your work out there in the public to boost your own fame. Even if you donâ€™t use the website for that purpose, there are many other reasons to utilize the website; like sharing photos with friends and families.</h3></center>
